# Conservation of Greenery

*“Hello, everyone. Good Morning Everyone, Thank you for having me. My name is Kshitij Vijay Jadhav, I am from std 8 Div A and I am going to be speaking to you all today about Conservation of greenery. To begin, Conservation of greenery.”*

    *As the term suggests, green conservation means conserving the greenery; the trees and the entire plantation around us. It is common sense that we could not survive without the help of the plants and the trees around us.*

*What If, trees and plants were not there? We could not Live without them because of them, we live, because oxygen is provided by the trees along with inhaling carbon dioxide. They serve all the living- beings without asking for anything in return.* 

*Human beings on the other hand instead of appraising this quality are only involved in using the trees to fulfil their own interests. Yes it is true that there are people who even sacrificed their lives in green conservation such as those involved in the **Chipko Movement in 1970s.***

*Some of us may have experienced that sometimes we feel **sophisticated** why do we feel* **sophisticated?** because there are few plants, trees around us. Therefore let’s take a promise that we would plant at least one or more plant in a year for ourselves and for our next **generation.**

**I Would Like to conclude this Speech with a Small Quote**

> ***“Don’t make trees rare, keep them with care.”***
